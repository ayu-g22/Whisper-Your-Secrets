"Whisper Your Secrets" is a web application I created for people dealing with mental health disorders, allowing them to share secrets anonymously. I used React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with MongoDB for data storage. The app features user authentication for secure and private secret submissions and an intuitive interface for seamless interaction. My focus was on privacy and enhancing the user experience.
